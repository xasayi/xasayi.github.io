    <br><font size="-1">(2024, Supervised by Prof. David Lie) <a href="files/Thesis_Final_Report.pdf">Bachelor's thesis pdf</font></a></h3>
  <p>The widespread use of MLaaS cloud applications is accompanied by increasing data privacy risks, 
      where third-party cloud adversaries can potentially exploit and abuse sensitive user data. However, 
      many data privacy schemes sacrifice model data utility and performance efficiency in exchange for privacy. 
      This thesis investigated a privacy-preserving inference infrastructure that uses model extraction methods 
      to maintain model performance while preserving privacy. In particular, knowledge distillation and 
      active learning techniques are used to build the infrastructure, tested in the NLP domain. 
      The thesis evaluates different means to preserve privacy and performes analysis on their effectiveness, showing 
      how employing a public dataset in the model extraction based inference infrastructure provides strong 
      privacy while maintaining model performance, outperforming state-of-the-art methods such as using differential privacy noise.</p>

  <h3> Are You Spreading COVID Misinformation? A study on misinformation trends on Twitter <br> <font size="-1"><a href="files/UnBDC2021.pdf">Paper pdf</a>
    </font></h3>
  <p> The spread of misinformation has been exacerbated by the onset of the pandemic, 
    as the use of remote and online resources has increased due to restrictions on offline interactions. While
    some misinformation are harmless, others can lead to the public panic and serious health concerns. 
    Therefore, detecting and removing misinformation is crucial. In this project, we examine the correlation between
    influential Twitter accounts and the spread of misinformed claims related to COVID-19 on Twitter. As expected, we 
    find that there is a positive correlation between real tweets and health organization accounts while other 
    types of accounts don't have a significant relationship with fake with real sweets. Furthermore, we also observe that
    sentiment is not a driving factor in the spread of misinformation. This work was top 15 in the <a href =

    <br><font size="-1">(2020-2021, Supervised by Prof. Amar Vutha)</font></h3>
  
    <p> The samarium experiment searches for a narrow spectroscopic feature in a crystal that is lower-doped with
    samarium ions to make a ultra-precise atomic clock. The desired transition that has the feature includes 
    a forbidden transition that can only be achieved by induced magnetic state mixing, giving rise to a weak transition.
    To increase the signal from the transition, I worked on increasing the signal to pinpoint the narrow feature. 
    I performed simulations in Zemax Optics to determine an optimal lens configuration, analyzed how different lens 
    combinations can increase the PMT collection efficiency, created computer aided designs for a lens system to integrate 
    into to the original vaccume cryostat, and wrote code to performed real time analysis on experiments. 
    My work resulted in an 8x increase in the signal collection frequency as well as a redesign of experimental components 
    to increase the modularity and scalability.

      (2021, Supervised by Prof. Xinyu Liu)</font></a></h3>
    <p> The pandemic highlighted the urgent need for rapid high-sensitivity diagnostic testing for large-scale
    population screening. I worked on optimizing the design of such lateral flow test strips for COVID diagnostics. I manufactured
    and tested different designs of the flow strip with several conjugates to find the best design. I was able to achieve 
    a detection limit of 10ng/ml for N proteins in SARS-CoV-2 using spiked blood samples.
